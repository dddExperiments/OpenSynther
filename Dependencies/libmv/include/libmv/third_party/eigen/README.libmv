Project: Eigen
URL: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
License: LGPL3 or GPL2
Upstream version: 2.0.3, released June 21, 2009

Local modifications:

  * Add NumTraits for "unsigned long"; used in our SURF implementation.
  * Fixed a minor assert bug in Map.h.
  * Fixed an "unused variable" warning in SVD.h.
  * Fixed another "unused variable" warning in SVD.h, in release mode.
  * Added missing placement operator delete to match placement new.

Note: Only the license and Eigen/ directory is included.
Note: For now, the CMake build system for Eigen is not included because we only
need the headers; until we need our own sparse bundler it can stay out.
